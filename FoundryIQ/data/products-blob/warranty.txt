# Microsoft Hardware Warranty
Product Warranty 🛡️
Warranty Coverage

Microsoft hardware products are backed by a Limited Hardware Warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.

Surface devices, Xbox consoles, and accessories include a 1-year limited warranty from the original date of purchase unless otherwise specified.

This warranty covers hardware failures such as manufacturing defects, internal component malfunctions, battery defects beyond expected degradation, and display issues not caused by accidental damage.

Business and enterprise editions may include extended warranty options, device replacement services, or Microsoft Complete protection plans for additional coverage.

FAQs

- What does the Microsoft hardware warranty cover?
The warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship that arise during normal use. This includes issues with processors, memory, storage, displays, power components, and internal hardware assemblies.

- What is not covered by the warranty?
The warranty does not cover accidental damage, drops, liquid damage, cosmetic wear, unauthorized repairs, software issues, data loss, or damage caused by misuse or environmental conditions outside recommended operating ranges.

- Do Microsoft devices come with accidental damage protection?
Standard warranties do not include accidental damage. However, customers may purchase Microsoft Complete, which adds accidental damage coverage, express replacement, and priority support.

- How long do Surface and Xbox batteries last under warranty?
Batteries are covered against manufacturing defects but are considered consumable components. Normal battery capacity reduction over time is expected and not considered a defect.

You can check warranty coverage by registering your device using its serial number at account.microsoft.com/devices.

- Is international warranty support available?
Warranty service availability may vary by country. Microsoft provides global support, but replacement options and timelines depend on regional service centers.

Depending on the product and issue, Microsoft may offer repair, refurbished replacement, or equivalent device replacement at its discretion.

- What if my device arrives defective or damaged?
If your device arrives defective or damaged, contact Microsoft Support within 7 days of delivery for expedited replacement or refund processing.

- Are software issues covered under the hardware warranty?
Software issues are not covered under the hardware warranty, but Microsoft provides troubleshooting support, updates, and recovery tools at no additional cost.

- Do accessories have the same warranty coverage?
Most Microsoft accessories (keyboards, mice, pens, controllers) include a 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects.
